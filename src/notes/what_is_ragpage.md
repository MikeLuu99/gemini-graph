Have you ever faced an essay deadline looming large, only to be constantly interrupted by the research rabbit hole? You fire up your browser to check a fact, get sucked into a Wikipedia vortex, and suddenly two hours have vanished. Then there's the endless thesaurus hunt for that perfect synonym, the grammar checker ping-pong, and maybe even a detour to ChatGPT to rephrase a clunky sentence.

Sound familiar? We've all been there. Research and writing, especially for complex projects, can feel like a never-ending juggling act of constantly switching between different tools and tabs. Additionally, by changing your screen to a different app, have you also fall into the trap of procrastination when a notifications appear on your browser. But what if there was a tool that could streamline the process, keeping you focused and saving you precious time?

Yeah. rag.page. That is what you need to avoid all the unnecessary burdens of managing your own document stores and researching for a facts. So how do we solve that initial problem?

By adding all the necessary tools in one place.

Now, you don’t have to open dozen of tabs and applications on your desktop. Instead, you can just focus on crafting new ideas, what your brain are truly great at. rag.page is made to handle all the trivial part in a creative process, storing and recalling information. This is where the idea of a second brain come in.

Specifically, a second brain is a structured document system to store all of your meaningful notes, ideas, and insights for recall. This system is significant because it offloads a large mental capability of the brain into the main creative task for more efficiency. Now, you can feel less stress about that writing assignment or that report that due tomorrow with rag.page. You can learn more about the topic of the “Second Brain“ via the book “Building a Second Brain“ by Tiago Forte or read my initial blog “The vision for the next generation of note-taking apps“.
